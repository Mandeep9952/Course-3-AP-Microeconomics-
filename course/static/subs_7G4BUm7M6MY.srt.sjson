    "Now we&#39;re going to talk about all of the combinations",

    "Let&#39;s draw a graph", 
    "that tells us all of the different combinations", 
    "of 2 goods, to which we are indifferent.", 
    "Like we&#39;ve mentioned before,", 
    "we&#39;re focusing on 2 goods,", 
    "because if we did 3 goods", 
    "we would have to do it in 3 dimensions", 
    "and 4 goods would get very abstract.", 
    "Let&#39;s say in this axis, the vertical axis,",

    "This is 20.", 
    "This is 10 and this is 20.", 
    "This will be 15, 5.", 
    "5 and then 15.",

    "that axis is your Y axis,", 
    "that is your X axis.", 
    "When we think about slope",

    "you can imagine it&#39;s really the slope",

    "&quot;Look, if we want an extra \u2026&quot;",

    "based on the slope right over there,", 
    "it looks like we&#39;re going to have to give up 5 bars.", 
    "This is 5 and this is 2.", 
    "What is your change in ...", 
    "What is the slope here?", 
    "The slope here is going to be", 
    "your change in bars.", 
    "I should actually say", 
    "this is a negative right over there.", 
    "It&#39;s going to be your change in bars,",

    "In this situation,", 
    "it is negative 5 bars",

    "Or, you can say this is equal to", 
    "negative 2.5 bars per fruit.", 
    "Bars per fruit.",

    "how are you willing to trade off", 
    "bars for fruit.", 
    "Exactly at that point", 
    "it&#39;s going to change", 
    "as things change along this curve.", 
    "Say, exactly where you&#39;re sitting right now", 
    "you would be indifferent", 
    "only as you just slightly move,", 
    "or for an extra drop of fruit", 
    "an extra ounce of fruit,", 
    "not even a whole pound,", 
    "you would be willing to trade off", 
    "2.5 bars per fruit.", 
    "What this says,", 
    "so you&#39;re willing to give up,", 
    "since it&#39;s negative", 
    "you&#39;re giving up 2.5 bars of chocolate", 
    "for every pound of fruit.",

    "It is much flatter.", 
    "Let me draw it in a color we haven&#39;t used yet.", 
    "Over here the tangent line", 
    "looks something like this.", 
    "It looks something like this.", 
    "Let&#39;s say, when you calculate it,", 
    "in order to get ...", 
    "I don&#39;t know,", 
    "this looks like about 5 pounds of fruit.", 
    "In order to get 5 pounds of fruit,", 
    "you&#39;re going to have to give up", 
    "2 bars.", 
    "Once again,", 
    "the slope is the change", 
    "in the vertical axis,", 
    "over the change in the horizontal axis.", 
    "Over here at this point,", 
    "your change in bars,", 
    "over your change in fruit,",

    "for every 5 fruit.", 
    "Bars per fruit.", 
    "Bars per fruit.", 
    "This right over here", 
    "is negative,", 
    "this is negative .4,", 
    "negative 0.4.",

    "to give up fewer bars", 
    "for every incremental fruit.", 
    "Up here you were willing", 
    "to give many bars away for every fruit.", 
    "That makes sense.", 
    "Over here you had a lot of chocolate bars,", 
    "not a lot of fruit,", 
    "so you were willing to give up more bars", 
    "for your fruit.", 
    "Over here,", 
    "you have many fewer bars.", 
    "You&#39;re much more resistant", 
    "to giving up bars for fruit.", 
    "This number,", 
    "how many bars you&#39;re willing to give up", 
    "for an incremental fruit,", 
    "at any point,", 
    "at any point here,", 
    "or you can view it as", 
    "the slope of the indifference curve,", 
    "the slope", 
    "or the slope of a tangent line", 
    "at that point of the indifference curve.", 
    "This right over here", 
    "is called our marginal rate of substitution.", 
    "Marginal rate of substitution.", 
    "It&#39;s a very fancy word,", 
    "but all it&#39;s really saying is,", 
    "how much you&#39;re willing to give up", 
    "of the vertical axis", 
    "for an increment of the horizontal axis.", 
    "Right at that point it changes.", 
    "As soon as you move,", 
    "because this is a curve, it changes a little bit.", 
    "Right at that point,", 
    "for a super, super small amount,", 
    "how many bars", 
    "are you willing to give up?", 
    "Obviously it changes", 
    "as we go along this indifference curve."
