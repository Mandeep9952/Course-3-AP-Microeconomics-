    "above the green line and below this curve right here", 
    "was the consumer surplus.", 
    "Now we&#39;ve lost part of it.", 
    "We&#39;ve lost this part right over here,", 
    "so this is our dead weight loss.", 
    "This is no longer part of the total consumer", 
    "and producer surplus.", 
    "That is dead weight loss.", 
    "The taxation got us from an efficient situation,", 
    "where we had that maximum consumer", 
    "and producer surplus.", 
    "This is our dead weight loss over here.", 
    "How much revenue is the government going to get now?", 
    "Well, if we assume that this is 3 million,", 
    "they&#39;re going to have 3 million burgers.", 
    "This is 3 million right over here.", 
    "They&#39;re going to have 3 million burgers",

    "Let me do it this way.",

    "This length right over here is 3.", 
    "That length right over there is 3 million", 
    "and then height is that dollar.", 
    "Let me shade it in.", 
    "The height is that dollar right over there.", 
    "This is going to be $1 height.", 
    "The tax revenue that the government is going to get", 
    "is 3 million times $1.", 
    "3 million burgers times $1, which is going to be", 
    "$3 million per day, which is interesting,", 
    "because maybe the government officials thought", 
    "they were going to get more, because they look", 
    "at the projections and they say, &quot;Wait.", 
    "&quot;There&#39;s going to be 3.5 million burgers sold per day,",

    "to be 3 million.", 
    "The way we see it, it removed this surplus here,",

    "and the producer surplus and no one&#39;s getting that,", 
    "not even the government&#39;s getting that.", 
    "No one&#39;s getting that white part right over there",

    "the area of triangles.", 
    "We would actually have to do a little calculus", 
    "to figure out the area of these curves.", 
    "Then the consumer surplus has been pushed back", 
    "to this area above the orange right over here.", 
    "You see, governments, for the most part,", 
    "have to do some type of taxation in order to get revenue", 
    "and it could be income tax or it could be a sales tax,", 
    "like this right over here, but when they do it,", 
    "it gets us into a non-efficient state", 
    "and it does cause some, depending on how these curves", 
    "are shaped, it does cause some dead weight loss.", 
    "Some benefit in excess of what had to be paid,", 
    "some of that disappears, but it allows, at least,", 
    "the government to get revenue, depending on whether", 
    "you think that&#39;s a good thing or not."
