    "We&#39;re going to think about it", 
    "in 2 different ways.", 
    "We&#39;re going to think about it", 
    "in terms of an accounting profit,", 
    "which is really the type of profit", 
    "that most of us associate", 
    "with a business or a firm.", 
    "We&#39;re also going to think about it", 
    "in terms of economic profit,", 
    "which we&#39;ll see is a little bit different.", 
    "Instead of telling us whether a business", 
    "is producing income,", 
    "it tells us whether it makes sense", 
    "to even run the business", 
    "in the way that we&#39;re", 
    "actually running it.", 
    "First, let&#39;s focus on", 
    "the traditional way", 
    "of calculating profit.", 
    "Let&#39;s say my firm,", 
    "my restaurant,", 
    "(my firm in a restaurant)", 
    "in year 1 it brings in, in revenue,", 
    "it brings in $500,000.",

    "the customers pay me to eat at the restaurant.", 
    "They are paying for their dinners.", 
    "This is literally the money that&#39;s coming in the door.", 
    "Sometimes people call it the top line,",

    "Expenses.", 
    "Now, when you&#39;re running a restaurant", 
    "one of the obvious expenses", 
    "is going to be the cost of food.", 
    "Food, we&#39;re going to say", 
    "cost us $100,000.", 
    "$100,000.", 
    "Then, you have the cost of labor.",

    "How much profit do I have", 
    "before paying tax,", 
    "or essentially my pretax profit?", 
    "The reason why we think of it in those terms", 
    "is because the amount you pay in tax",

    "That depends on where this business is,",

    "what type of business it is.", 
    "The easy way to calculate pretax profit,", 
    "pretax profit.",

    "all of the payments we essentially have to make", 
    "to other people.", 
    "What we have left is out pretax profit.", 
    "500,000 minus 450,000", 
    "gives us a pretax profit",

    "or all of this",

    "Who knows what I might do with that money.", 
    "This is just traditional accounting profit.", 
    "This is how profit is calculated.",

    "In economic terms, I&#39;m not profitable.", 
    "The important thing to realize",

    "or at least to run this business in this way.", 
    "If this was 0, that means,", 
    "hey, it&#39;s probably making money,", 
    "but you&#39;re kind of neutral whether it makes sense", 
    "to run it this way or not.", 
    "If it&#39;s positive, that means", 
    "it definitely does make sense to run the firm in this way", 
    "and that it is definitely doing better", 
    "than all of the alternatives.", 
    "This right over here is saying,", 
    "look, you&#39;re making $50,000 a year,", 
    "that&#39;s the 50,000 that you have to spend,", 
    "if you&#39;re the owner,",

    "Instead of making $50,000 doing this,", 
    "you could have been making $100,000 more",
