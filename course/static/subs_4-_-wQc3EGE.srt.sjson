    "than the first fruits,", 
    "so that&#39;s where we spent it.",

    "for that 1st pound of fruit,", 
    "so we spend it there.", 
    "Then for the 3rd pound or for the 3rd bar of chocolate.", 
    "Then it became equal to spend for the 1st pound of fruit", 
    "so then we spent the next $2 on that 1st pound of fruit", 
    "because the price of fruit were $2.", 
    "What I want to do in this video", 
    "is explore what happens when I change the price", 
    "of the chocolate bars.", 
    "What happens to our marginal utility per dollar over here?", 
    "In particular, what happens to the quantity demanded?", 
    "If you think about what we&#39;re doing it,", 
    "we figured out with 1 price", 
    "what was the quantity demanded,", 
    "we demanded 3 bars.", 
    "If we change the price",

    "we&#39;re essentially starting to plot our our demand curve",

    "Well, for that first bar, I&#39;m still getting 100 points", 
    "of marginal utility, but now it&#39;s $2.", 
    "So 100 divided 2 is going to give me", 
    "50 marginal utility points per dollar.", 
    "Then for that next bar,", 
    "I get 80 marginal utility points.", 
    "I&#39;m still enjoying it but enjoying it a little bit less",

    "I&#39;m getting 80 divided by 2 is 40 points,", 
    "you know, and I&#39;m just giving these arbitrary units,", 
    "40 points per dollar.", 
    "Then the 3rd bar is 30 points per dollar.",

    "My first dollar, where would I get the most",

    "My 1st dollar, I can&#39;t use these numbers,", 
    "this is when the bars were a dollar per bar,", 
    "now they&#39;re $2 per bar. This is the reality.", 
    "Now actually it makes sense for me to, at least,", 
    "for that 1st dollar I can buy a half pound of my fruit", 
    "at a marginal utility per dollar of 60.", 
    "My 1st dollar will go towards .5 pounds of fruit", 
    "and I&#39;m getting a marginal utility per dollar of 60.",

    "Remember, we have to ignore these right here", 
    "for the sake of this argument", 
    "or for the sake of this scenario right now.", 
    "I could still get another half pound", 
    "for marginal utility per dollar of 60,",

    "and my marginal utility per dollar is 60.", 
    "Now, where is my 3rd dollar,", 
    "my 3rd dollar going to be spent?", 
    "Well, I could spend it now", 
    "at a rate of a dollar per half bar,", 
    "or $2 per bar for chocolate", 
    "or a dollar per half bar, $2 per bar for fruit over here.", 
    "I&#39;m actually neutral.", 
    "I could spend it.", 
    "Let me just, for the sake of fun,", 
    "say list on half a bar of chocolate", 
    "and my marginal utility per dollar is 50.", 
    "Then my 4th dollar, once again,", 
    "I could do a couple of different things here.",

    "at this marginal utility per dollar up to a whole bar.",

    "Then my 5th dollar over here, what would I do with that?", 
    "Well, I don&#39;t want to buy any more chocolate bars",

    "of the chocolate bar", 
    "because I&#39;ve exhausted what I can buy at this utility,", 
    "this utility per dollar.", 
    "My marginal utility per dollar has gone down now,", 
    "but now I could still buy fruit", 
    "at that same 50.", 
    "Now, with that dollar, since the fruit is $2 per pound,", 
    "I can buy another half pound of fruit", 
    "at a marginal utility per dollar rate of 50.", 
    "Now I buy another half pound of fruit", 
    "at a marginal utility per dollar of 50.", 
    "You can calculate the total marginal utility I got,", 
    "this is the marginal utility per dollar", 
    "and this is a dollar spent", 
    "at that marginal utility per dollar.", 
    "My total utility I should say,", 
    "the marginal utility is the increment,", 
    "but my total utility now is 60 + 60 is 120", 
    "plus 50 + 50 + 50.", 
    "So it&#39;s 120 + 150 = 270 total utility.", 
    "Even more interesting here,", 
    "let&#39;s think about the quantity of chocolate bars", 
    "that I have now bought once the price is gone up.", 
    "I have now bought exactly 1 chocolate bar.", 
    "You could say my 3rd and 4th dollars",
