    "you would have this curve shift up even more",

    "as much quantity isn&#39;t being consumed.", 
    "But here, a tax could actually prevent", 
    "a dead weight loss because if you have", 
    "a 2 cent tax, essentially adding the cost", 
    "of the negative externality in the form of a tax", 
    "on top of the supplier&#39;s cost right over here,", 
    "you are going to cause the equilibrium quantity",

    "and it&#39;s just a positive side effect,", 
    "and once again, this is all assuming", 
    "that this is the right number,", 
    "but it would be a positive side effect", 
    "that you would also generate some revenue", 
    "for the government.", 
    "What&#39;s good about the tax in this circumstance", 
    "right over here, you&#39;re not assuming anything", 
    "about what the marginal cost curve looks like", 
    "or what the demand curve looks like.", 
    "As long as you&#39;re assuming that this", 
    "is the right number,", 
    "the tax will always shift whatever", 
    "the marginal cost curve is,", 
    "it&#39;ll always shift it to the right point", 
    "to intersect wherever the demand curve is", 
    "at this equilibrium point,", 
    "that gives us an equilibrium price", 
    "and an equilibrium quantity.", 
    "So if this is the right number and", 
    "you put a 2 cent tax per bag,", 
    "a 2 cent tax per bag,",

    "in terms of optimizing the total surplus."
