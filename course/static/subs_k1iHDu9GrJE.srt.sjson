    "The fixed cost,", 
    "no matter how many lines of code we&#39;ve produced,",

    "That as we add more and more programmers,", 
    "the average productivity per programmer goes down",

    "11,400 lines of code per month,",

    "as we add more developers,", 
    "it still adds cost,", 
    "because obviously they&#39;re going to cost something.", 
    "We have to pay their salaries",

    "but then our total productivity", 
    "starts going down again.", 
    "That&#39;s what we&#39;re seeing here", 
    "when both the variable cost curve", 
    "and our total cost curve start curving back on itself.", 
    "Now, with this plotted,", 
    "what I want to think about visually,",

    "I encourage you to,", 
    "if the term slope seems a little bit foreign to you,", 
    "there&#39;s tons of videos on the idea of slope",

    "but the slope is really just how inclined a line is.", 
    "For example, this line has a higher slope", 
    "than this line right over there.", 
    "That the way we measure it", 
    "is our change in our vertical axis,",

    "often given by a change in y,", 
    "the triangles, that&#39;s the delta,", 
    "Greek letter \u0394, means change in Y", 
    "divided by our change in,", 
    "divided by our change in our horizontal axis,", 
    "that is change in X.",

    "this line over here,", 
    "it looks like it has about the same change in x,", 
    "but has a much lower change in y,", 
    "lower change in y.", 
    "So when you take this lower change in y", 
    "divided by the same change in x,", 
    "you&#39;re going to get a lower slope.", 
    "If you had a line that looked something like,", 
    "if you had a line that looked", 
    "something like this,", 
    "then you have a much higher change in y,", 
    "so your numerator is higher,", 
    "a higher change in y,", 
    "and you have a lower change in x.", 
    "Your denominator&#39;s lower.", 
    "That&#39;ll increase the value of the quantity,", 
    "so your change in x.", 
    "This right over here is going to be a high slope,", 
    "a high slope.", 
    "With that little primer out of the way", 
    "on what a slope is,", 
    "what I want to do is think about", 
    "these average fixed costs,", 
    "average variable costs,", 
    "average total costs,", 
    "and marginal costs", 
    "in terms of slopes of these lines",

    "I&#39;m on this green line right over here.", 
    "To find that average,", 
    "so that&#39;s our,", 
    "that is our,", 
    "that is our fixed cost.", 
    "To find our average fixed cost,", 
    "we want to divide our fixed cost,", 
    "which is that height right over there.", 
    "You want to divide it by the total lines of code,", 
    "and that gives us our fixed cost,", 
    "our average fixed cost per line of code.", 
    "We&#39;re taking a change in the vertical axis", 
    "divided by our change in a horizontal axis right there,", 
    "so it&#39;s essentially giving the slope of this line,", 
    "just like that.", 
    "It&#39;s giving the slope of that line,", 
    "and that&#39;s this point right over here.", 
    "When you go to this point right over here,", 
    "you&#39;re saying, &quot;Okay.", 
    "&quot;I&#39;m producing 7,000 lines of code,", 
    "&quot;and it still costs me $15,000.&quot;", 
    "That&#39;s $15,000.", 
    "I divide my total change in fixed costs,", 
    "divided by my", 
    "or my total fixed cost", 
    "divided by my total lines of code,", 
    "divided by my total lines of code.", 
    "I&#39;m essentially getting the slope of,", 
    "I know it&#39;s getting hard to see,", 
    "the way I&#39;m doing it.", 
    "I&#39;m essentially giving you the slope of,", 
    "let me draw a little bit neater,", 
    "this line right over here.", 
    "You could see this line has a lower slope", 
    "than the previous one,", 
    "and that makes sense", 
    "because the average fixed cost per line of code", 
    "should be going down.", 
    "We have the same fixed cost", 
    "and we&#39;re dividing it amongst more", 
    "and more and more code.", 
    "You can see if you go out here,", 
    "and you do the slope from this point", 
    "all the way over here,", 
    "it&#39;s going to have even a little,", 
    "even a lower slope,", 
    "so let me clear this out of the way,", 
    "so hopefully that makes sense.", 
    "The fixed cost, at least for me,", 
    "is maybe the easiest to understand.", 
    "You&#39;re taking the same quantity,", 
    "dividing it by more and more code,", 
    "or by more and more developers.", 
    "Now, the variable cost, average variable cost,", 
    "at any given point over here,", 
    "we&#39;re taking the variable cost,", 
    "and we&#39;re dividing it by the total amount of code.", 
    "So variable costs,", 
    "over there it is $10,000,", 
    "and we&#39;re dividing it by 4,000 lines of code,", 
    "so it is the slope of this line right over here.", 
    "When you go to 7,000 lines of code,", 
    "you say, &quot;Well, my total variable cost is $20,000,", 
    "&quot;and I&#39;m going to divide it by 7,000 lines of code.&quot;", 
    "So it is the slope of this entire line right over here.", 
    "I&#39;m having trouble drawing these lines.", 
    "It is the slope of this line right over here.", 
    "This is a curve,", 
    "so the slope is different here than it is over there.", 
    "This line,", 
    "when we&#39;re measuring the average variable costs,", 
    "we&#39;re measuring,", 
    "you can imagine the average slope across", 
    "from the beginning all the way to this point", 
    "right over here.", 
    "Now, when you&#39;re doing the average total cost,", 
    "you&#39;re doing the same thing.", 
    "The average total cost at that point", 
    "is our total, total cost,", 
    "so it&#39;s that, divided by,", 
    "divided by the total code,", 
    "so the total code.", 
    "So it is the slope of this line right over there.", 
    "We see that, that slope, when you start over here,", 
    "when you start from this point to that point,", 
    "the slope goes down,", 
    "but then we see the slope start going,", 
    "it starts to go up again", 
    "because we saw that the variables cost", 
    "start increasing", 
    "because we get less and less efficiency", 
    "as we add more and more developers", 
    "and attempt, at least, to write more code.", 
    "Now, the marginal cost is an interesting one.", 
    "All of these other ones,", 
    "we&#39;re taking our total cost,", 
    "our total variable cost,", 
    "our total total cost,", 
    "our total fixed cost,", 
    "and dividing by the total amount of code,", 
    "so we&#39;re essentially finding the slope of a line", 
    "between these points and our origin.", 
    "When you&#39;re doing the marginal cost,", 
    "you&#39;re doing something different.", 
    "Let me clear all of this out", 
    "so that we can clear things up.", 
    "Your marginal cost is you&#39;re measuring", 
    "your change in total cost divided by,", 
    "not your total total cost,", 
    "you&#39;re doing your change in total cost", 
    "divided by your change in the lines of code.", 
    "So, for example, that right over,", 
    "let me do that in a more vibrant color.", 
    "That marginal cost,", 
    "that&#39;s at this point right over here,", 
    "so let&#39;s say we&#39;re going to,", 
    "we can do it with the variable cost curve", 
    "or we could do it with the total cost curve.", 
    "i&#39;ll do it with the total cost curve,", 
    "so it&#39;s this point right over here.", 
    "What we&#39;re doing is,", 
    "we&#39;re taking the change in total cost", 
    "between the previous point.", 
    "The previous point was there,", 
    "so our change in total cost", 
    "is just this part right over here,", 
    "so this is our change in total cost,", 
    "and we&#39;re dividing it by our change", 
    "in the amount of code we produce.", 
    "So we&#39;re dividing it by the change in,", 
    "change in lines of code.", 
    "So essentially, it&#39;s giving us the slope of the line", 
    "between the previous point and the current point", 
    "on the total cost curve.", 
    "We could do it,", 
    "so if we go right over here.", 
    "Let me go to another arbitrary point", 
    "that doesn&#39;t start from the beginning.", 
    "Let&#39;s say we&#39;re looking at this marginal cost.", 
    "This was when we&#39;re talking about", 
    "10,600 lines of code,", 
    "and our total cost was $65,000.", 
    "So our total cost is $65,000,", 
    "10,600 lines of code.", 
    "That&#39;s that point right over there.", 
    "What this is measuring,", 
    "it&#39;s our change in total cost", 
    "since the last increment,", 
    "so since the last increment,", 
    "since the last point.", 
    "It&#39;s our change in total cost.", 
    "it&#39;s our change in total cost", 
    "divided by the change in lines of code", 
    "since the last point,", 
    "so the change of lines of code is just that,", 
    "change in lines of code.", 
    "Our marginal cost is this quantity", 
    "divided by this quantity.", 
    "It&#39;s the slope between these two consecutive points.", 
    "What the marginal cost is giving us,", 
    "so I just want to make sure we get everything clear,", 
    "these average fixed, average variable,", 
    "average total cost,", 
    "that gives us a slope of the line", 
    "between any of the points and the origin.", 
    "The marginal cost is essentially giving us", 
    "the slope of the curve", 
    "between any two consecutive points", 
    "on the total cost curve,", 
    "or you could also view,", 
    "because it&#39;s really just a shifted version", 
    "of the variable cost curve,", 
    "or you could do this as the same", 
    "as the slope of the line", 
    "between any two points on the variable cost curve.", 
    "This is an approximation", 
    "you could do this as the average,",
