    "Narrator: What I want to do in this video", 
    "is think about why it&#39;s so hard for", 
    "a monopolistic competitor to make money", 
    "in the long run.", 
    "Just as a reminder, a monopolistic competitor", 
    "is much closer to perfect competition then it is", 
    "to a monopoly.", 
    "What it means is that you have a monopoly", 
    "in your differentiated product,", 
    "but eventually other people are going to make", 
    "substitute products.", 
    "They can&#39;t make exactly your product,", 
    "it can&#39;t be identical and it might eat", 
    "into your demand.", 
    "To understand that, let us draw the demand curve", 
    "for a market in which monopolistic competition", 
    "is going on.", 
    "I will draw it nice and big.", 
    "In this axis right over here I&#39;m going to plot", 
    "dollars per unit and so price is revenue", 
    "per unit and we&#39;ll have cost per unit", 
    "and things like that.", 
    "And in this axis I&#39;m going to have quantity produced", 
    "in an given period of time.", 
    "We&#39;re going to speak in fairly general terms", 
    "over here.", 
    "Now, let&#39;s assume that our monopolistic competitor", 
    "right over here is Apple and it&#39;s iPad&#39;s.", 
    "(writing) Apple, iPad&#39;s.", 
    "I want to emphasize, I&#39;m not making any accusations", 
    "that Apple is a monopolist here.", 
    "They just have a differentiated product", 
    "and so they are monopolistic competitors here,", 
    "they have a monopoly in iPad&#39;s.", 
    "They don&#39;t have a monopoly in Tablet computers", 
    "or computers in general, but only they can", 
    "sell iPad&#39;s.", 
    "So, let&#39;s draw the demand curve in the short run", 
    "for iPad&#39;s and I&#39;ll make it linear to", 
    "make things simple.", 
    "Let me draw a little bit better than that.", 
    "Let&#39;s say the demand curve looks something", 
    "like that.", 
    "That is our demand curve and we know that if that&#39;s", 
    "the demand curve and remember we&#39;re talking about", 
    "the market for iPad&#39;s, not the market for Tablet", 
    "computers, Apple is the monopolist in the market", 
    "for iPad&#39;s, so it&#39;s marginal revenue will have", 
    "twice the slope of this demand curve.", 
    "So, it will look something like that.", 
    "That is Apple&#39;s marginal revenue curve", 
    "and then think about its short run economic profit", 
    "in a given period of time, whatever this quantity", 
    "per period of time is.", 
    "Let&#39;s draw its cost, so first I&#39;ll draw ...", 
    "Let me draw its marginal cost,", 
    "so its marginal cost might look something like this.", 
    "That is their marginal cost and then to do average", 
    "total cost, up here when you have very low quantity,", 
    "most of your costs are fixed cost,", 
    "but you&#39;re dividing it by a very small quantity", 
    "so you&#39;re going to have a very high", 
    "average total cost.", 
    "It&#39;s going to get lower and lower and lower", 
    "as long as the cost on each incremental unit", 
    "is lower than the average", 
    "and the cost on each incremental unit is", 
    "a marginal cost curve.", 
    "As long as an average total cost is higher", 
    "than the marginal cost curve, that&#39;s going to be", 
    "downward sloping, and at some point they&#39;re going", 
    "to be equal to each other.", 
    "Now, each incremental unit that you add on", 
    "is going to increase the average", 
    "because each incremental unit&#39;s cost is more", 
    "than the average, so it&#39;s going to cause everything", 
    "to average up.", 
    "This actually right over here should be the", 
    "minimum point on our average total cost curve.", 
    "Given the way I&#39;ve drawn things, what is Apple&#39;s", 
    "short run economic profit?", 
    "We just have to think of its optimal quantity", 
    "to produce.", 
    "It&#39;s definitely going to produce one,", 
    "so the marginal revenue much higher than the", 
    "marginal cost is going to make economic profit", 
    "on that unit, it&#39;s going to keep producing", 
    "because that continues to be true all the way", 
    "until this point right over here.", 
    "It doesn&#39;t want to produce more than that because", 
    "the opportunity cost on each incremental unit", 
    "is higher than the revenue on that,", 
    "so you&#39;re going to take an economic loss.", 
    "So, you&#39;re going to produce right over there", 
    "and at that quantity, I&#39;ll call that Q*", 
    "right over there.", 
    "At that quantity this is the price that they", 
    "can charge in the market going in to", 
    "the demand curve.", 
    "I just went straight up to the demand curve", 
    "over there.", 
    "This is the price that they can charge", 
    "in the market and there average or you could view", 
    "that as their average revenue per unit.", 
    "Then we have our average cost per unit", 
    "right over here, an average total cost.", 
    "This is their average economic profit per unit.", 
    "If we multiply that times the total number of units.", 
    "If we multiply times the total number of units", 
    "the area of this rectangle right over here", 
    "is going to give total economic profit.", 
    "(writing) total, total, economic, economic,", 
    "economic profit.", 
    "Now, in all things, if the rest of the world sees", 
    "economic profit they&#39;re just like,",

    "that the demand curve is shifting to the left,",
