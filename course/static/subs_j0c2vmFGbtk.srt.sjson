    "in this way so we can apply some of these basic ideas", 
    "that we&#39;re being exposed to in this survey", 
    "of microeconomics, so that we can apply",

    "huge oversimplifications and often times the real context",

    "have any specific training or experience for a given job.", 
    "The vertical axis is their wage rate per hour.",

    "per month.", 
    "Once again, we have this little gap here, so we can jump", 
    "to 20 million hours, 21 million hours.", 
    "It&#39;s important to realize, when we think about demand", 
    "in the labor market, we&#39;re not talking", 
    "about individual consumers, we&#39;re talking", 
    "about employers.", 
    "In most cases, demand comes",

    "These are the people who are essentially buying labor.", 
    "The supply is not coming from corporations.",

    "who want to work, but there&#39;s only demand",

    "Right here, this is going to be an oversupply of labor.", 
    "Another way to think about it, there&#39;s only jobs",

    "close to zero unemployment.", 
    "Now you have more people looking for jobs,", 
    "because the wages have gone, but fewer jobs,", 
    "because the employers are forced to pay more.",

    "what the quantity demanded was and that&#39;s also", 
    "where the quantity supplied was,", 
    "but now its only 21 million.", 
    "Based on this model, you&#39;re going", 
    "to have 1 million fewer jobs.", 
    "When you think about it in terms of surplus.", 
    "Before the minimum wage, the entire surplus", 
    "was this entire area over here.", 
    "This entire area that&#39;s below the demand curve", 
    "and above the supply curve.", 
    "This entire area was the total surplus", 
    "and it was being divided between the consumer surplus", 
    "and the producer surplus.", 
    "This right over here, between the price", 
    "and the supply curve was the producer surplus.", 
    "The producer surplus, remember the producers of labor", 
    "are the individual workers.", 
    "This was the benefit above and beyond", 
    "the opportunity cost that the workers were getting", 
    "was this area right over here that I&#39;m doing in dark white", 
    "or filled in white and the consumer surplus", 
    "or the employer surplus here was the value", 
    "that the employers were getting above and beyond", 
    "the price that they had to pay.", 
    "Now, in this situation of a minimum wage,", 
    "now this is the set price, this is the quantity of labor", 
    "that is demanded.", 
    "What you lose now, the surplus that we lose", 
    "is this quantity right over here.",

    "For the first 21 million units of labor, it&#39;s redistributing",
