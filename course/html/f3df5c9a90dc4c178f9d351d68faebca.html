<h2>Entry and exit decisions in the long run</h2>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1">
<div class="paragraph">The line between the short run and the long run cannot be defined precisely with a stopwatch, or even with a calendar. It varies according to the specific business. The distinction we'll use to distinguish between the short run and the long run in this article is therefore more technical&mdash;in the short run, firms cannot change the usage of fixed inputs, while in the long run, the firm can adjust all factors of production.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="2">
<div class="paragraph">In a competitive market, profits are a red cape that incites businesses to charge. If a business is making a profit in the short run, it has an incentive to expand existing factories or to build new ones. New firms may start production as well. When new firms enter the industry in response to increased industry profits, it is called <em>entry</em>.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="3">
<div class="paragraph">Losses are the black thundercloud that causes businesses to flee. If a business is making losses in the short run, it will either keep limping along or just shut down, depending on whether its revenues are covering its variable costs. But in the long run, firms that are facing losses will shut down at least some of their output, and some firms will cease production altogether. The long-run process of reducing production in response to a sustained pattern of losses is called <em>exit</em>.</div>

<div class="paragraph">What causes a firm to exit an industry? Profits! Profits are the measurement that determines whether a business stays operating or not.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1">
<div class="paragraph">Individuals start businesses with the purpose of making profits. They invest their money, time, effort, and many other resources to produce and sell something that they hope will give them something in return. Unfortunately, not all businesses are successful, and many new startups soon realize that their business adventure must eventually end.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="2">
<div class="paragraph">In the model of perfectly competitive firms, those that consistently cannot make money will exit, which is a polite word for a more painful process. When a business fails, after all, workers lose their jobs, investors lose their money, and owners and managers can lose their dreams. Many businesses fail. The US Small Business Administration indicates that in 2011, 409,040 new firms entered and 470,376 firms failed.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="3">
<div class="paragraph">Sometimes a business fails because of poor management or workers who are not very productive, or it fails because of tough domestic or foreign competition. Businesses also fail from a variety of causes that might best be summarized as bad luck. For example, conditions of demand and supply in the market shift in an unexpected way so that the prices that can be charged for outputs fall or the prices that need to be paid for inputs rise.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="4">
<div class="paragraph">With millions of businesses in the US economy, even a small fraction of them failing will affect many people&mdash;not least of all the workers and managers directly involved. But from the standpoint of the overall economic system, business exits are sometimes a necessary evil if a market-oriented system is going to offer a flexible mechanism for satisfying customers, keeping costs low, and inventing new products.</div>

<h2>How entry and exit lead to zero profits in the long run</h2>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1">
<div class="paragraph">No perfectly competitive firm acting alone can affect the market price. However, the combination of many firms entering or exiting the market will affect overall supply in the market. In turn, a shift in supply for the market as a whole will affect the market price. Entry and exit to and from the market are the driving forces behind a process that&mdash;in the long run&mdash;pushes the price down to minimum average total costs so that all firms are earning a zero profit.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="2">
<div class="paragraph">To understand how short-run profits for a perfectly competitive firm will evaporate in the long run, imagine the following situation.

<div class="paragraph">Let&rsquo;s say that the product&rsquo;s demand then increases, causing the market price to go up.

<div class="paragraph">This will temporarily make the market price rise above the average cost curve, and therefore, the existing firms in the market will now be earning economic profits. However, these economic profits attract other firms to enter the market. Entry of many new firms causes the market supply curve to shift to the right. As the supply curve shifts to the right, the market price starts decreasing, causing economic profits to fall for new and existing firms. As long as there are still profits in the market, entry will continue to shift supply to the right. This shift will stop whenever the market price is driven down to the zero-profit level, where no firm is earning economic profits.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Exit of many firms causes the market supply curve to shift to the left. As the supply curve shifts to the left, the market price starts rising, and economic losses start to be lower. This process ends whenever the market price rises to the zero-profit level, where the existing firms are no longer losing money and are at zero profits again.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="8">
<div class="paragraph">Thus, while a perfectly competitive firm can earn profits in the short run, in the long run the process of entry will push down prices until they reach the zero-profit level. On the other hand, while a perfectly competitive firm may earn losses in the short run, firms will not continuously lose money. Firms making losses are able to escape from their fixed costs, and their exit from the market will push the price back up to the zero-profit level in the long run.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="9">
<div class="paragraph">This process of entry and exit will drive the price in perfectly competitive markets in the long run to the zero-profit point at the bottom of the AC curve, where marginal cost crosses average cost.</div>

<h2>The long-run adjustment and industry types</h2>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1">
<div class="paragraph">Whenever there are expansions in an industry, costs of production for the existing and new firms can either stay the same, increase, or decrease. Therefore, we can categorize an industry as being one of the following:</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="2">
<ul>
<li>A constant cost industry&mdash;meaning that as demand increases, the cost of production for firms stays the same</li>
<li>An increasing cost industry&mdash;meaning that as demand increases, the cost of production for firms increases</li>
<li>A decreasing cost industry&mdash;meaning as demand increases the costs of production for the firms decreases</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="3">
<div class="paragraph">For a constant cost industry, whenever there is an increase in market demand and price, the supply curve shifts to the right as new firms enter and stops at the point where the new long-run equilibrium intersects at the same market price as before. But why will costs remain the same?</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="4">
<div class="paragraph">In this type of industry, the supply curve is very elastic. Firms can easily supply any quantity that consumers demand. In addition, there is a perfectly elastic supply of inputs&mdash;firms can easily increase their demand for employees, for example, with no increase to wages. Agricultural markets are generally good examples of constant cost industries.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="5">
<div class="paragraph">For an increasing cost industry, as the market expands, old and new firms experience increases in their costs of production, which makes the new zero-profit level intersect at a higher price than before. In this type of industry, companies may have to deal with limited inputs, such as skilled labor. As the demand for these workers rise, wages rise, increasing the cost of production for all firms. The industry supply curve in this type of industry is more inelastic.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="6">
<div class="paragraph">For a decreasing cost industry, as the market expands, old and new firms experience lower costs of production, which makes the new zero-profit level intersect at a lower price than before. In this case, the industry and all the firms in it are experiencing falling average total costs. This can be due to an improvement in technology in the entire industry or an increase in the education of employees. High tech industries may be a good example of a decreasing cost market.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="7">
<div class="paragraph">Diagram A below shows the adjustment process for a constant cost industry. Whenever there are output expansions in this type of industry, the long-run outcome implies more output produced at exactly the same original price. Note that in this example, supply was able to increase to meet the increased demand. When we join the before and after long-run equilibriums, the resulting line is the long run supply&mdash;or LRS&mdash;curve in perfectly competitive markets. In this case, it is a flat curve.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="8">
<div class="paragraph">Diagram B and diagram C show the adjustment processes for an increasing cost and decreasing cost industry, respectively. For an increasing cost industry, the LRS is upward sloping; for a decreasing cost industry, the LRS is downward sloping.</div>

<div class="paragraph">An adjustment process will take place in the market if there is a technological improvement that brings about a reduction in costs of production. The technological improvement will result in an increase in supply curves by individual firms and at the market level. The existing firms will experience higher profits for a while, which will attract other firms into the market. This entry process will stop whenever the market supply increases enough&mdash;both by existing and new firms&mdash;so profits are driven back to zero.</div>

<div class="paragraph">When wages increase, costs of production increase. If wages increase, some firms would be making economic losses and would shut down. The supply curve would then start shifting to the left, pushing the market price up. This process ends when all firms remaining in the market earn zero economic profits. The result is a contraction in the output produced in the market.</div>
