<h2>Pollution</h2>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1">
<div class="paragraph">From 1970 to 2012, the population of the United States increased by one-third and the size of the US economy more than doubled. Despite this growth, the United States, using a variety of anti-pollution policies, has made genuine progress against a number of pollutants.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="2">
<div class="paragraph">According to the US Energy Information Administration, the emissions of certain key air pollutants declined substantially from 2007 to 2012; in fact, they dropped 730 million metric tons a year&mdash;a 12% reduction. This seems to indicate that progress has been made in the United States in reducing overall carbon dioxide emissions, which cause greenhouse gases.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="3">
<div class="paragraph">Despite the gradual reduction in emissions from fossil fuels, many important environmental issues remain. Along with the still-high levels of air and water pollution, other issues include hazardous waste disposal, destruction of wetlands and other wildlife habitats, and the impact of pollution on human health.</div>

<h2>Externalities</h2>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1">
<div class="paragraph">Private markets offer an efficient way to put buyers and sellers together and determine what goods are produced, how they are produced, and who gets them. The principle that voluntary exchange benefits both buyers and sellers is a fundamental building block of the economic way of thinking. But what happens when a voluntary exchange affects a third party who is neither the buyer nor the seller?</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="2">
<div class="paragraph">Consider, for example, a concert producer who wants to build an outdoor arena that will host country music concerts a half-mile from your neighborhood. You will be able to hear these outdoor concerts while sitting on your back porch&mdash;or perhaps even in your dining room. In this case, the sellers and buyers of concert tickets may both be quite satisfied with their voluntary exchange, but you have no voice in their market transaction.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="3">
<div class="paragraph">The effect of a market exchange on a third party who is outside, or external, to the exchange is called an <em>externality</em>. Because externalities that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those involved, they are sometimes called <em>spillovers</em>.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="4">
<div class="paragraph">Externalities can be negative or positive. If you hate country music, then having it waft into your house every night would be a <strong>negative externality</strong>. If you love country music, then what amounts to a series of free concerts would be a <strong>positive externality</strong>.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The situation is not actually that simple, however. Pollution is created as a byproduct of the metals, plastics, chemicals, and energy that are used in manufacturing refrigerators. Let&rsquo;s say that, if these pollutants were emitted into the air and water, they would create costs of $100 per refrigerator produced. These costs might occur because of injuries to human health, impact on property values, destruction of wildlife habitat, reduction of recreation possibilities, or because of other negative impacts.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="6">
<div class="paragraph">In a market with no anti-pollution restrictions, firms can dispose of certain wastes at no cost. Now imagine that firms that produce refrigerators must factor in these <em>external costs</em> of pollution&mdash;that is, the firms have to consider not only the costs of labor and materials needed to make a refrigerator but also the broader costs to society from pollution. If the firm is required to pay $100 for the additional external costs of pollution each time it produces a refrigerator, production becomes more costly and the entire supply curve shifts up by $100.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="7">
<div class="paragraph">Notice the fourth column of the table above. Taking external costs of pollution into account, the firm will need to receive a price of $700 per refrigerator and produce a quantity of 40,000.

<div class="paragraph">Step 1. Determine the negative externality in this situation. To do this, you must think about the situation described and consider all parties that might be impacted. A negative externality might be the increase in noise pollution in the area where the firm is playing.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="3">
<div class="paragraph">Step 2. Identify the equilibrium price and quantity when only private costs are taken into account, and then when social costs are taken into account. Remember that equilibrium is where the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="4">
<div class="paragraph">Step 3. Look down the columns to where the quantity demanded&mdash;the second column&mdash;is equal to the quantity supplied without paying the costs of the externality&mdash;the third column. Then, refer to the first column of that row to determine the equilibrium price. In this case, the equilibrium price and quantity when only private costs are taken into account would be at a price of $10 and a quantity of five.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="5">
<div class="paragraph">Step 4. Identify the equilibrium price and quantity when the additional external costs are taken into account. Look down the columns of quantity demanded&mdash;the second column&mdash;and the quantity supplied after paying the costs of the externality&mdash;the fourth column. Then, refer to the first column of that row to determine the equilibrium price. In this case, the equilibrium will be at a price of $12 and a quantity of four.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="6">
<div class="paragraph">Step 5. Consider how taking the externality into account affects the equilibrium price and quantity. Do this by comparing the two equilibrium situations. If the firm is forced to pay its additional external costs, then production of trumpet songs becomes more costly, and the supply curve will shift up.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="9">
<div class="paragraph">Remember that supply curves are based on choices about production that firms make while looking at their marginal costs; demand curves are based on the benefits that individuals perceive while maximizing utility. If no externalities existed, private costs would be the same as the costs to society as a whole, and private benefits would be the same as the benefits to society as a whole. Thus, if no externalities existed, the interaction of demand and supply would coordinate social costs and benefits.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="10">
<div class="paragraph">But the reality is that externalities <em>do</em> exist. Because of this, a supply curve showing private costs doesn't actually represent all social costs.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="11">
<div class="paragraph">Because externalities represent a case where markets no longer consider all social costs but only some of them, economists commonly refer to externalities as an example of <em>market failure</em>. When there is market failure, the private market fails to achieve efficient output because either firms do not account for all costs incurred in the production of output and/or consumers do not account for all benefits obtained, in the case of a positive externality. In the case of pollution, at the market output, social costs of production exceed social benefits to consumers, and the market produces too much of the product.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="12">
<div class="paragraph">There's a general concept here. If firms are required to pay the social costs of pollution, they create less pollution but produce less of the product and charge a higher price.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The original equilibrium&mdash;before the external cost of pollution is taken into account&mdash;is where the private supply curve crosses the demand curve. This original equilibrium is at a price of $15 and a quantity of 440. After taking into account the additional external cost of pollution, the production becomes more costly, and the supply curve shifts left. The new equilibrium will be at a price of $30 and a quantity of 410.</div>
