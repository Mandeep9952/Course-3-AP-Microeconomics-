<div class="paragraph">If you've ever been to a mall, you've probably discovered that you can't buy every single thing that strikes your fancy. Individuals must constantly choose which things they desire most among a number of things they would love to have.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Society as a whole can't have everything it might want, either. In this article, we'll examine the constraints faced by society using a model called the <em>production possibilities frontier</em>, or PPF.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Society is big and complex, but there are more similarities than differences between individual choice and societal choice. If you focus on the similarities, you'll find it easier to make the jump from thinking about individual choice to societal choice.</div>

<h2>The production possibilities frontier and social choices</h2>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1">
<div class="paragraph">Because society has limited resources&mdash;for example, labor, land, capital, and raw materials&mdash;at any point in time, there is a limit to the quantities of goods and services it can produce. Let's suppose a society desires two products: healthcare and education. Just like you might have to chose how many shirts vs. pants you want to buy at the mall, society will have to decide how to allocate its resources to acquire healthcare and education.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="2">
<div class="paragraph">The graph below&mdash;a healthcare vs. education production possibilities frontier&mdash;can help us understand the choices our hypothetical society can make. Notice that healthcare is shown on the vertical axis and education is shown on the horizontal axis.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The graph shows that a society has limited resources and often must prioritize where to invest. On it, the y-axis is healthcare, and the x-axis is education. The production possibilities front slopes downward from point A&mdash;high on the y axis and at zero on the x axis, indicating that all resources have been spent on healthcare&mdash;to point F&mdash;far to the right on the x axis and at zero on the y axis, indicating that all resources have been spent on education.</div>

<div class="paragraph">If our society were to allocate all of its resources to healthcare, it could produce a lot of healthcare! This situation is represented by point A on the production possibilities frontier. But if the society spends all of its resources on healthcare, it won't have any resources left to produce education. What about the opposite situation? If our hypothetical society allocates all of its resources to education, it will have a lot of education, but no healthcare&mdash;point F. Alternatively, the society could choose to produce any combination of healthcare and education shown on the production possibilities frontier, including those represented by points B, C, and D.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="5">
<div class="paragraph">In effect, the production possibilities frontier plays the same role for society as the budget constraint plays for an individual.

<h2>The PPF curve and the law of diminishing returns</h2>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1">
<div class="paragraph">There are two major differences between a budget constraint and a production possibilities frontier:</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="2">
<ul>
<li>
<div class="paragraph">There are no specific numbers on the axes of our PPF because we do not know the exact amount of resources our imaginary economy has, nor do we know how many resources it takes to produce healthcare or education. If this were a real world example, that data would be available, but we still couldn't use numbers on our axes because there is no single way to measure levels of education and healthcare.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="paragraph">A budget constraint is a straight line. This is because its slope is given by the relative prices of two goods. In contrast, the PPF has a curved shape.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="3">
<div class="paragraph">To understand why the PPF is curved, let's start by considering point A at the top left-hand side of our healthcare-education PPF. At point A, all available resources are devoted to healthcare and none are left for education. This situation would be extreme&mdash;even ridiculous.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="4">
<div class="paragraph">For example, children could see a doctor every day, whether they are sick or not, but they could not attend school. Now imagine that some of our society's resources are diverted from healthcare to education, so that the economy is at point B instead of point A. Diverting some resources away from point A to point B causes relatively little reduction in healthcare because the last few marginal dollars going into healthcare services are not producing much additional gain in health. However, putting those marginal dollars into education&mdash;which is completely without resources at point A&mdash;can produce relatively large gains. For this reason, the shape of the PPF from point A to point B is relatively flat, representing a relatively small drop-off in healthcare and a relatively large gain in education.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="5">
<div class="paragraph">Now consider the other end, at the lower right, of the production possibilities frontier. Imagine that our society starts at point D&mdash;it is devoting nearly all resources to education and very few to healthcare. Then, our society moves to point F, choosing to devote <em>all</em> spending to education and none to healthcare.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="6">
<div class="paragraph">For the sake of concreteness, you can imagine that in the movement from point D to point F, the last few doctors must become high school science teachers. The gains to education from adding these last few resources to education would be very small. However, the opportunity cost lost to health would be fairly large, and thus the slope of the PPF between point D and point F is steep, showing a large drop in healthcare for only a small gain in education.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="7">
<div class="paragraph">The lesson is not that society is likely to make an extreme choice like devoting no resources to education or no resources to healthcare. Instead, the lesson is that the gains from committing additional marginal resources to an endeavor&mdash;be it healthcare or education or something else entirely&mdash;depend on how much is already being spent.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="8">
<div class="paragraph">If on the one hand, very few resources are currently committed, then an increase in committed resources can bring relatively large gains. On the other hand, if a large number of resources are already committed, then using additional resources will bring relatively smaller gains.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="9">
<div class="paragraph">This pattern is common enough that it has been described by economists as the <strong>law of diminishing returns</strong>, which holds that as additional increments of resources are added to a certain purpose, the marginal benefit from those additional increments will decline.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="10">
<div class="paragraph">The curvature of the production possibilities frontier shows that as additional resources are added to education, moving from left to right along the horizontal axis, the original gains are fairly large but gradually diminish. Similarly, as additional resources are added to healthcare, moving from bottom to top on the vertical axis, the original gains are fairly large but again gradually diminish.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="11">
<div class="paragraph">In this way, the law of diminishing returns produces the outward-bending shape of the production possibilities frontier.</div>

<h2>Productive efficiency and allocative efficiency</h2>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1">
<div class="paragraph">Economists aren't trying to run the world. In a market-oriented economy with a democratic government, societal choices are made by a combination of individuals, firms, and government. But, some choices <em>are</em> unambiguously better than others, and economists work to point these out.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="2">
<div class="paragraph">How do they know? They use the concept of efficiency.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="3">
<div class="paragraph">In everyday usage, efficiency refers to lack of waste. An inefficient machine operates at high cost, while an efficient machine operates at lower cost because it is not wasting energy or materials. An inefficient organization operates with long delays and high costs, while an efficient organization meets schedules, is focused, and performs within budget.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="4">
<div class="paragraph">The production possibilities frontier can illustrate two kinds of efficiency: <em>productive efficiency</em> and <em>allocative efficiency</em>. Let's look at another PPF between healthcare and education to further examine the idea of efficiency.</div>

<div class="paragraph"><em>Productive efficiency</em> means that, given the available inputs and technology, it is impossible to produce more of one good without decreasing the quantity that is produced of another good. All choices on the PPF above&mdash;including points A, B, C, D, and F&mdash;display productive efficiency.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="7">
<div class="paragraph">As a society moves from any one of these choices to any other, either healthcare increases and education decreases or vice versa. However, any choice that our hypothetical society makes that lies <em>inside</em> the production possibilities frontier is productively inefficient and wasteful because it is possible to produce more healthcare, more education, or some combination of both.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="8">
<div class="paragraph">For example, point R is productively inefficient because it is possible at point C to have more of both goods: education on the horizontal axis is higher at point C than point R&mdash;E2 is greater than E1&mdash;and healthcare on the vertical axis is also higher at point C than point R&mdash;H2 is great than H1.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="9">
<div class="paragraph"><strong>Allocative efficiency</strong> means that the particular mix of goods a society produces represents the combination that society most desires.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="10">
<div class="paragraph">But how can anyone know what society desires? It's a question that almost certainly right at this moment is being discussed in political science, sociology, and philosophy&mdash;and yes, economics&mdash;classrooms around the world!</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="11">
<div class="paragraph">Most simply, we can say that allocative efficiency means producers supply the quantity of each product that consumers demand. Only one of the productively efficient choices will be the allocatively efficient choice for society as a whole.</div>

<h2>Why society must choose</h2>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1">
<div class="paragraph">Every economy faces two situations in which it may be able to expand consumption of all goods:</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="2">
<ul>
<li>
<div class="paragraph">A society may discover that it has been using its resources inefficiently. By improving efficiency and producing on the production possibilities frontier, it can have more of all goods&mdash;or at least more of some without giving anything up.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="paragraph">As resources grow over a period of years&mdash;for example, more labor and more capital&mdash;the economy grows. As it does, the production possibilities frontier for a society will tend to shift outward and society will be able to afford more of all goods.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="3">
<div class="paragraph">The problem is, improvements in productive efficiency take time to discover and implement, and economic growth happens only gradually. So, in the present, a society must choose between tradeoffs.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="4">
<div class="paragraph">For government, this process often involves trying to identify where additional spending could do the most good and where reductions in spending would do the least harm. At the individual and firm level, the market economy coordinates a process in which firms seek to produce goods and services in the quantity, quality, and price that people want.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="5">
<div class="paragraph">But neither the government nor the market economy can escape the fact that in the short term, increases in production of one good typically mean offsetting decreases somewhere else in the economy.</div>

<h2>The PPF and comparative advantage</h2>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1">
<div class="paragraph">While every society must choose how much of each good it should produce, it does not need to produce every single good it consumes. Often a country&mdash;one type of society&mdash;decides how much of a good to produce based on how expensive it is to produce the good versus buying it from a different country.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="2">
<div class="paragraph">As we saw earlier, the curvature of a society's PPF gives us information about the tradeoff between devoting resources to producing one good versus another. In particular, its slope gives the opportunity cost of producing one more unit of the good in the x axis in terms of the other good in the y axis. Countries tend to have different opportunity costs of producing a specific good, either because of different climates, geography, technology, or skills.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="3">
<div class="paragraph">Suppose two countries, the United States and Brazil, need to decide how much they will produce of two crops: sugar cane and wheat. Due to its climatic conditions, Brazil can produce a lot of sugar cane per acre but not much wheat. On the other hand, the United States can produce a lot of wheat per acre but not much sugar cane.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="4">
<div class="paragraph">Brazil has a lower opportunity cost of producing sugar cane&mdash;in terms of wheat&mdash;than the United States. The reverse is also true: the United States has a lower opportunity cost of producing wheat than Brazil.</div>

<div class="paragraph">When a country can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another country, we say that this country has a <em>comparative advantage</em> in that good.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="8">
<div class="paragraph">In our example, Brazil has comparative advantage in sugar cane, and the United States has comparative advantage in wheat. Take a look at the PPFs of the two countries. If Brazil devoted all of its resources to producing wheat, it would be producing at point A. If, however, it devoted all of its resources to producing sugar cane instead, it would be producing a much larger amount, at point B. By moving from point A to point B, Brazil would give up a relatively small quantity in wheat production to obtain a large production in sugar cane. The opposite is true for the United States. If the United States moved from point A to point B and produced only sugar cane, its choice would result in a large opportunity cost in terms of sacrificed wheat production.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="9">
<div class="paragraph">Another way to think about this is to take the slope of the PPF, which gives the opportunity cost of producing an additional unit of wheat. While slope is not constant across different PPFs, we can still see that the PPF in Brazil is much steeper than in the United States, and therefore the opportunity cost of wheat is generally higher in Brazil.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="10">
<div class="paragraph">When countries engage in trade, they specialize in the production of the goods that they have comparative advantage in and trade part of that production for goods they do not have comparative advantage in.

</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="11">
<div class="paragraph">With trade, goods are produced where the opportunity cost is lowest, so total production increases, benefiting both trading parties.</div>

<h2>Key concepts and summary</h2>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1">
<div class="paragraph">A <em>production possibilities frontier</em>, or PPF, defines the set of possible combinations of goods and services a society can produce given the resources available. The shape of the PPF is typically curved outward, rather than straight, due to the law of diminishing returns. Choices outside the PPF are unattainable and choices inside the PPF are wasteful. Over time, a growing economy will tend to shift its PPF outwards.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="2">
<div class="paragraph">The <em>law of diminishing returns</em> holds that as additional resources are devoted to producing a good, the marginal increase in output will become smaller and smaller.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="3">
<div class="paragraph">All choices along a PPF display <em>productive efficiency</em>; that is, it is impossible to use society&rsquo;s resources to produce more of one good without decreasing production of the other good. The specific choice along a PPF that reflects the mix of goods society most desires is the choice with <em>allocative efficiency</em>.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="4">
<div class="paragraph">The curvature of the PPF is likely to differ by country, which results in different countries having <em>comparative advantage</em>&mdash;lower opportunity cost&mdash;in different goods. Total production can increase if countries specialize in the goods they have comparative advantage in and trade some of their production to other countries for other goods.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Both the budget constraint and the PPF show the limits the entity&mdash;an individual for the budget constraint and a society for the PPF&mdash;operate under. Both show a tradeoff between having more of one good but less of the other. Both show the opportunity cost graphically as the slope of the constraint.</div>

<h2>Critical thinking questions</h2>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1">
<div class="paragraph">During the Second World War, Germany&rsquo;s factories were decimated. It also suffered many human casualties, both soldiers and civilians. How did the war affect Germany&rsquo;s production possibilities curve?</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="2">
<div class="paragraph">It is clear that productive inefficiency is a waste since resources are being used in a way that produces fewer goods and services than a nation is capable of producing. Why is allocative inefficiency also wasteful?</div>
